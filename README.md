# Turret-System
Roblox studio module for making combat games

Import my .rbxm file into RB Studio
In the package you loaded, there is a script in the VehicleSeat. Please, if you want to control turret while driving a vehicle, put the launcher and the script to your vehicle seat !

Anyway, this has nothing yet, and what i'm saying is just predictions !
